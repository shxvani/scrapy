{"asin": "B0CZDG3M67", "text": "This is my honest review of the pool. I waited about three months before reviewing this item. I bought the 4 XL and this pool is 100% durable. I have two large dogs that love to jump in the pool to fetch their balls. I also have multiple young grandchildren that use this pool almost on a daily basis. And three months of daily use this pool shows absolutely no wear and tear. I love that it comes with a drainage plug and is easy to fold up and just throw in a corner of the yard when I\u2019m not using it.  I do move it to different spots in the yard around every two days just so it doesn\u2019t kill the grass underneath. After experimenting with different types of pools for the dogs to use in the summer, they never held up so I would buy this pool 100 times over. Even though this is a collapsible pool, the sides are 100% sturdy and has held up to the little ones sometimes sitting on the edges. The bottom of a pool is a really thick material that has held up to my dogs nails beautifully. I didn\u2019t realize that this pool pool also came in 16 inch deep instead of 12 so next year I would like to buy that one but honestly, I can\u2019t even justify it because this pool is still in such great condition. I don\u2019t leave many reviews, but I feel strongly that this is 100% worth the price for durability.", "title": "Great for dogs and small children.", "location_and_date": "Reviewed in the United States on July 22, 2024", "verified": true, "rating": "5.0"},

It\u2019s very easy to clean - we just empty it, spray it off and put it in the shed. I read so many reviews to see if I wanted to order and I say just do it!!

{"asin": "B0CZDG3M67", "text": "I live in Central Massachusetts , I  adopted a Lab/hound cross, hoping she would love the water, i first bought a cheap round kiddie pool from family dollar, SHE LOVED this thing with a bit of encouragement, so about 2 weeks later i discovered this on Amazon, i figured ok for the price why not. It seems durable the drain plug is a joke, at first I didnt think it would open, but it did, will it last longer than the pool?? Anyway my marley had a BLAST, come time to drain it again  A PAIN,  so what I dd was i got all the water out a bit of dirt from her running back and forth and jumping in the pool, My advice, wash it out after you drain it if you have that small plastic kiddie pool put that down first and put this pool over it it supports it til its used the next time. i figue if i get 3 more uses out of this with the CHEAP DRAIN PLUG, I'M happy.

{"asin": "B0CZDG3M67", "text": "Well, first, don't be fooled by the ad photos showing kids and dogs pasted into the image, okay?  Those photos wouldn't fool a child.  Seriously, look at the photos.  They are so phony.That said, the product arrives well-packed.  It's easy to unfold...there's really no set up required.  It might help to set it on a spot that has a very slight downward slope to it, after making sure the drain hole is closed and pointing towards the downward side.  Then just fill it with water and let the fun begin.  Right?  That's about as far as \"easy\" goes.When it's time to drain the pool, just open the drain plug and let it drain.  This pool will NOT drain completely just by opening the hole.  You're going to have to juggle it a bit, lifting it up on one side to get the rest of the water to (hopefully) drain.  But it probably won't.  Frankly, the only way to get all the water out is to lift it up and turn it upside down, and just let it sit there a while.  Ditto for getting rid of all the grass, twigs, dog hair, dirt, and dead bugs that accumulate in this pool.  This isn't the pool's fault...it's just what's gonna happen if you use it.  You'll need to hose down the inside of the pool.  You don't want your kids and dogs playing in muddy brown water.My end advice is to buy the largest size offered.  It may be a bit harder to empty and clean, but the extra room offsets the higher price.I can't comment on its sturdiness.  I have two Rottweilers.  They love it and haven't torn it up yet.  Have to wait and see how it holds up for three months or so.Most of these types of \"kiddie pools\"  are more or less the same.  You see one, you've seen 'em all.  They need to be larger and deeper for your big dogs to get the full benefit.This is something I'll use for my dogs for one summer, then fold it up and put it in the recycle bin.", "title": "Not Quite All It's Cracked Up To Be", "location_and_date": "Reviewed in the United States on June 24, 2024", "verified": true, "rating": "3.0"},

I decided to go with this and see how it goes, so far I feel it\u2019s rather safe for children and they can put ALL their toys in it, while having the dog in there and still have tons of room to play. I ended up getting the cover as well, and that could handle my large goat and baby goat walking on it, trying to find the water. My aussies scratched in the bottom to get a ball and so far no holes, no problems at all. So easy to clean, it\u2019s not slippery, dried fast (I live in the desert so not sure that says much).
