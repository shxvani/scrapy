{"asin": "B0CZDG3M67", "text": "This is my honest review of the pool. I waited about three months before reviewing this item. I bought the 4 XL and this pool is 100% durable. I have two large dogs that love to jump in the pool to fetch their balls. I also have multiple young grandchildren that use this pool almost on a daily basis. And three months of daily use this pool shows absolutely no wear and tear. I love that it comes with a drainage plug and is easy to fold up and just throw in a corner of the yard when I\u2019m not using it.  I do move it to different spots in the yard around every two days just so it doesn\u2019t kill the grass underneath. After experimenting with different types of pools for the dogs to use in the summer, they never held up so I would buy this pool 100 times over. Even though this is a collapsible pool, the sides are 100% sturdy and has held up to the little ones sometimes sitting on the edges. The bottom of a pool is a really thick material that has held up to my dogs nails beautifully. I didn\u2019t realize that this pool pool also came in 16 inch deep instead of 12 so next year I would like to buy that one but honestly, I can\u2019t even justify it because this pool is still in such great condition. I don\u2019t leave many reviews, but I feel strongly that this is 100% worth the price for durability.", "title": "Great for dogs and small children.", "location_and_date": "Reviewed in the United States on July 22, 2024", "verified": true, "rating": "5.0"},

{"asin": "B0CZDG3M67", "text": "I live in Central Massachusetts , I  adopted a Lab/hound cross, hoping she would love the water, i first bought a cheap round kiddie pool from family dollar, SHE LOVED this thing with a bit of encouragement, so about 2 weeks later i discovered this on Amazon, i figured ok for the price why not. It seems durable the drain plug is a joke, at first I didnt think it would open, but it did, will it last longer than the pool?? Anyway my marley had a BLAST, come time to drain it again  A PAIN,  so what I dd was i got all the water out a bit of dirt from her running back and forth and jumping in the pool, My advice, wash it out after you drain it if you have that small plastic kiddie pool put that down first and put this pool over it it supports it til its used the next time. i figue if i get 3 more uses out of this with the CHEAP DRAIN PLUG, I'M happy.

{"asin": "B0CZDG3M67", "text": "Well, first, don't be fooled by the ad photos showing kids and dogs pasted into the image, okay?  Those photos wouldn't fool a child.  Seriously, look at the photos.  They are so phony.That said, the product arrives well-packed.  It's easy to unfold...there's really no set up required.  It might help to set it on a spot that has a very slight downward slope to it, after making sure the drain hole is closed and pointing towards the downward side.  Then just fill it with water and let the fun begin.  Right?  That's about as far as \"easy\" goes.When it's time to drain the pool, just open the drain plug and let it drain.  This pool will NOT drain completely just by opening the hole.  You're going to have to juggle it a bit, lifting it up on one side to get the rest of the water to (hopefully) drain.  But it probably won't.  Frankly, the only way to get all the water out is to lift it up and turn it upside down, and just let it sit there a while.  Ditto for getting rid of all the grass, twigs, dog hair, dirt, and dead bugs that accumulate in this pool.  This isn't the pool's fault...it's just what's gonna happen if you use it.  You'll need to hose down the inside of the pool.  You don't want your kids and dogs playing in muddy brown water.My end advice is to buy the largest size offered.  It may be a bit harder to empty and clean, but the extra room offsets the higher price.I can't comment on its sturdiness.  I have two Rottweilers.  They love it and haven't torn it up yet.  Have to wait and see how it holds up for three months or so.Most of these types of \"kiddie pools\"  are more or less the same.  You see one, you've seen 'em all.  They need to be larger and deeper for your big dogs to get the full benefit.This is something I'll use for my dogs for one summer, then fold it up and put it in the recycle bin.", "title": "Not Quite All It's Cracked Up To Be", "location_and_date": "Reviewed in the United States on June 24, 2024", "verified": true, "rating": "3.0"},

Apple's engineers have leveraged the lessons they learned in designing the miniaturized iPad and applied them to the design of this 2.38-pound computer. To say that the Air is svelte is all at once stating the obvious and understating the truth. The system is defined by its unibody aluminum enclosure. At its thickest point the computer is only 0.68\" -- it tapers down to 0.11\" at its thinnest. The system is loaded with 128GB of flash storage rather than an old-fashioned hard drive. Flash storage doesn't just give you a lighter, thinner computer. It also allows for impressive battery life -- up to 9 hours of web browsing and 30 days of standby time. The MacBook Air is housed in an aluminum unibody enclosure, which is as strong as it is light. Because it is cut from a solid block of aluminum, the housing is stronger than those found on laptops built via traditional means. At 11.6\" in size, the 16:9 display features a native resolution of 1366 x 768. It features a glossy finish and LED backlight technology for enhanced image quality and energy efficiency.", "thumbnailUrl": "https://i5.walmartimages.com/seo/Restored-Apple-MacBook-Air-2015-11-6-inch-Intel-Core-i5-4GB-RAM-128GB-Flash-Storage-Bundle-Black-Case-Wireless-Mouse-Bluetooth-Wireless-Airbuds-By-Ce_156492e1-77be-40ed-883a-1c1dc3f72afc.9ded9b5b61259464d307b6758d3905f6.jpeg", "price": 136.5, "currencyUnit": "USD"},

{"keyword": "laptop", "page": 1, "position": 23, "id": "7HX2LPW04LNL", "type": "Laptop Computers", "name": "Restored Apple MacBook Air, 11.6\" Laptop, Intel Core i5, 4GB RAM, 128GB SSD, No, Mac OS, Silver, MJVM2LL/A (Refurbished)", "brand": "Apple", "averageRating": 3.2, "manufacturerName": null, "shortDescription": "The MacBook Air has been professionally inspected, cleaned, and tested in Refurbished with minor signs of usage. Includes all major accessories. The 11.6\" MacBook Air Notebook Computer (Early 2015) from Apple is an ultraportable notebook computer with a thin and lightweight design. Apple's engineers have leveraged the lessons they learned in designing the miniaturized iPad and applied them to the design of this 2.38-pound computer. To say that the Air is svelte is all at once stating the obvious and understating the truth. The system is defined by its unibody aluminum enclosure. At its thickest point the computer is only 0.68\" it tapers down to 0.11\" at its thinnest. The system is loaded with 128GB of flash storage rather than an old-fashioned hard drive. Flash storage doesn't just give you a lighter, thinner computer. It also allows for impressive battery life up to 9 hours of web browsing and 30 days of standby time. The MacBook Air is housed in an aluminum unibody enclosure, which is as strong as it is light. Because it is cut from a solid block of aluminum, the housing is stronger than those found on laptops built via traditional means. At 11.6\" in size, the 16:9 display features a native resolution of 1366 x 768. It features a glossy finish and LED backlight technology for enhanced image quality and energy efficiency. Computers in the MacBook Air's weight class are most often classified in the \"netbook\" category. Netbooks typically feature less-than-full-size keyboards, cramped trackpads, and low-powered CPUs. Not so with the MacBook Air. This computer features a standard-size backlit chiclet keyboard, the same as on the larger computers in the MacBook line. It also has a large multi-touch glass trackpad, giving you full control over your computer without sacrificing ergonomics. The computer is powered by a dual-core 5th-gen, low-voltage Broadwell 1.6 GHz Intel Core i5 processor and has 4GB of onboard 1600 MHz LPDDR3 RAM. Graphics are provided by integrated Intel HD Graphics 5000. The computer features all the amenities you expect on a Mac a FaceTime HD webcam, dual-band 802.11ac Wi-Fi (also compatible with 802.11a/b/g/n), Bluetooth 4.0 and built-in stereo speakers. This MacBook Air comes preloaded with the user-friendly Mac OS X operating system. The Mac OS X features Time Machine backup, which automatically backs up system data to an external hard drive. It also features natural scrolling, the Launchpad application launcher and support for full screen applications. Mission Control combines the functionality of Dashboard, Expos\u00e9, and Spaces giving you a bird's eye view of everything that is happening on your computer. The Auto Save feature on the MacBook Air ensures that you won't lose data, even when you forget to save a file. The OS tracks different versions of your documents, so you can go back to a previous draft of a document with ease. AirDrop makes it easy to transmit files wirelessly between computers, even if there is no central Wi-Fi network available. The revamped Mail application takes full advantage of modern widescreen displays. And of course, you can expand the functionality of your computer system by browsing through the multitude of productivity applications, games, and other software that is available for purchase from the Mac App Store. Because the software in the store is curated by Apple, you can be sure that it is free of malware and safe to use. And, like the iOS App Store, you'll automatically be notified when updated versions of your favorite programs are available for download.", "thumbnailUrl": "https://i5.walmartimages.com/seo/Restored-Apple-MacBook-Air-11-6-Laptop-Intel-Core-i5-4GB-RAM-128GB-SSD-No-Mac-OS-Silver-MJVM2LL-A-Refurbished_ff852eed-8de4-49ee-9425-e9f6bffb8488.f6fde8692401f239d38722da8981dce9.jpeg", "price": 129.9, "currencyUnit": "USD"},
