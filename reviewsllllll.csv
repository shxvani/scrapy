Delivers on Every Expectation",21/10/2023,"Having grown up on the NES and SNES, I was happy to see an entirely new 2D entry in the mainline mario series. After the phenomenal Super Mario Odyssey easily became my family's favorite video game during the pandemic, we were somewhat disappointed with the remakes that have been released since. It was an easy choice to pre-order Super Mario Wonder, but I was doubtful the experience could compare to Odyssey, despite more emphasis on co-op play.Gameplay:From the start screen, the essence of Mario games is captured perfectly in Super Mario Wonder. Levels oscillate between familiar terrains and novel landscapes. Most mario games offer something new that at first seems like it will disrupt the always-solid platforming experience and genius level design hallmark to 2D mario adventures. Wonder includes several new power-ups, an overwhelming number of one-at-a-time badges provide a small change in-stage, and the wonder flower induces brief level-warping or mario-warping mini-challenges. None of these are affect the game on the level of Oydssey's Cappy or Mario Sunshine's FLUDD. However, they are all interesting and worthy additions. They also allow for a solo base difficulty that is decidedly more challenging (as you get further into the game) than many other 2D Mario games. Yet, the game (as you would expect) is adaptive to a wide range of player skill because of the co-op, invincible characters (that don't need to be unlocked), new power-ups, and badges. Still, I do miss the simplicity of the platforming challenges hallmark to Mario games, which aren't quite as much on display here as compared to collecting star coins in New Super Mario Bros.Graphics:Graphically, the game delivers as much as the hardware allows. Detailed environments and distinct aesthetics for each world are evident. It can be a bit busy, but always fun. The level of polish is as good as any Mario game, which already sets the bar high. Character animations, character model design, enemy design, and effects, all add greatly to the experience.Controls:The controls, for the most part, are what you'd expect from a Mario title: reliable. Yet, during some platforming, my kids experienced issues they blamed on lagging response. It could have been that they were sitting too far from the Switch or that they are kids. I didn't notice any issues with input lag or imprecision. I also love that Nintendo just 2 core (run and jump) buttons are needed most of the time, supplementing with the top-right bumper button (or, alternatively, shaking the control) on occasion.Co-op:The co-op mode is where ""Super Mario Wonder"" truly attempts to bridge the generational gap. Collaborating with my children, combining our abilities to face challenges, is a great way to spend time together. The characters that don't receive damage from enemies make it easy for novices to contribute to the progress and keep up with more advanced players.Overall Assessment:Super Mario Wonder delivers on combining many of the most beloved and nostalgiac components of former 2D Mario adventures while avoiding the trap of feeling like an updated version of a previous game. My kids enjoyed the new features more than I did, with my 8-year old laughing hysterically every time I hop along as a crouched elephant Mario. I'll update as we continue our adventure...",63 people found this helpful,N/A

Simply Wonderful",21/11/2023,"Mario has always been present in my life. My first serious interactions that my memory recalls is from Super Smash Bros Melee, he was the headliner, the face of Nintendo, but I still would rather play as Link. I dabbled here and there with the 2D games often getting too frustrated with them and not feeling enough of a hook to continue with the harder levels, let alone beat the whole game.My first Mario game that I really played through and throughly enjoyed was Mario Odyssey. A great 3D plat-former. I wouldn’t put it up there with my all time favorites but I had a great time with it.When Nintendo revealed Super Mario Bros Wonder back a few months ago, I shrugged it off and made no plans to play it (I was salty about the lack of a Wind Waker port announcement being made on Switch and still am). But I had been hearing some buzz about it and thought I’d pick it up as a birthday gift to myself sense I hadn’t been playing any games as of late.All that to say, this game is simply wonderful. “Wonder” was the perfect title for this game. It had such a sense of joy, and glee about its creativity and is a celebration of what Mario is. You really get a sense of how much everyone who worked on this game really love what they do. They made something truly special.The gameplay is tight, responsive, challenging, and a blast to play. The level design is out of this world creative, second to none, can’t think of a game that has done it better, the graphics are gorgeous, and the music is perfect.I’m not the best at 2D platformers so I struggled with a few of the levels, and I can’t really compare the difficulty level with this and other Mario’s, but I’m going to have to go back and play some other 2D titles now.Overall, I highly recommend this game. It’s a joy to play and really brings back what games are supposed to be about: fun gameplay and a fun experience with none of the strings attached like the rest of the gaming landscape right now.10/10",23 people found this helpful,N/A

Super Mario Bros.™ Wonder - Nostalgia Unleashed!",29/12/2023,"The Super Mario Bros.™ Wonder brings a wave of nostalgia, making it a must-have for fans of the iconic Nintendo franchise. From the charming characters to the vibrant graphics, this game encapsulates the magic that made Mario a household name.The gameplay is engaging, with clever level design and a delightful mix of classic elements and innovative twists. The controls are responsive, providing a seamless experience for players of all skill levels. The inclusion of various power-ups and surprises adds an extra layer of excitement, keeping the adventure fresh and entertaining.However, one aspect that could be improved is the soundtrack. While the familiar tunes are there, the overall audio quality doesn't quite match the brilliance of the visuals. Some tracks sound a bit tinny, and for those who hold the original game's music close to their hearts, this might be a bit disappointing.Despite this minor audio hiccup, Super Mario Bros.™ Wonder is a joyous journey into the Mushroom Kingdom that will captivate both longtime fans and new players alike. It's a delightful addition to any gaming collection, offering a charming blend of classic and contemporary Mario magic.",10 people found this helpful,N/A
